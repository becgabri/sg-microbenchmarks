This repository contains scripts that allow the end-user to estimate the communication and computation costs of the honest majority, constant-round MPC protocol presented in "Scalable Multiparty Garbling". For information on how to choose the number of parties, types of circuits to run the protocol with and more, use the help flag (-h) with each script.
